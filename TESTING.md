# Testing Documentation for CarTechStore

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy and implementation for the CarTechStore e-commerce platform. The testing suite is comprehensive and covers multiple layers of the application.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Location: `backend/__tests__/unit/`
- Purpose: Test individual components in isolation
- Coverage: Models, utilities, and helper functions
- Framework: Jest
- Example: `User.test.js` tests the User model's methods

### 2. Integration Tests
- Location: `backend/__tests__/integration/`
- Purpose: Test interactions between components
- Coverage: API endpoints, database operations
- Framework: Jest + Supertest
- Example: `auth.test.js` tests authentication flow

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- Location: `backend/__tests__/e2e/`
- Purpose: Test complete user flows
- Coverage: Critical user journeys
- Framework: Jest + Supertest
- Example: `order.test.js` tests the complete order process

### 4. Performance Tests
- Location: `backend/__tests__/performance/`
- Purpose: Test system performance and scalability
- Coverage: API response times, concurrent requests
- Framework: Jest + Supertest
- Example: `api.test.js` tests API performance

### 5. Security Tests
- Location: `backend/__tests__/security/`
- Purpose: Test security measures
- Coverage: Authentication, authorization, input validation
- Framework: Jest + Supertest
- Example: `auth.test.js` tests security features

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.x
- npm >= 7.x

### Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:security
npm run test:performance

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

## Test Coverage

The project aims for the following coverage targets:
- Statements: 80%
- Branches: 75%
- Functions: 85%
- Lines: 80%

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are automatically run in the CI/CD pipeline:
1. On every push to main and develop branches
2. On every pull request
3. Before deployment to production

The pipeline includes:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests
- Security tests
- Performance tests
- Code coverage reporting
- Security scanning

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Keep tests independent
4. Clean up after tests
5. Mock external dependencies

### Code Organization
1. Group related tests in describe blocks
2. Use beforeEach/afterEach for setup/cleanup
3. Keep test files focused and small
4. Follow the same structure as the source code

### Performance Considerations
1. Use appropriate timeouts
2. Clean up resources after tests
3. Mock heavy operations
4. Use test databases

## Security Testing

### Areas Covered
1. Authentication
   - Login attempts
   - Password policies
   - Token validation

2. Authorization
   - Role-based access
   - Resource permissions
   - API endpoint security

3. Input Validation
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS prevention
   - Input sanitization

4. Rate Limiting
   - API request limits
   - Brute force protection

## Performance Testing

### Metrics
1. Response Time
   - Average: < 200ms
   - 95th percentile: < 500ms
   - 99th percentile: < 1000ms

2. Throughput
   - Concurrent users: 100
   - Requests per second: 50

3. Resource Usage
   - CPU: < 70%
   - Memory: < 80%
   - Database connections: < 50

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Database connection errors
   - Check test database configuration
   - Verify database is running
   - Check connection strings

2. Timeout errors
   - Increase timeout in setup.js
   - Check for long-running operations
   - Verify async operations

3. Coverage issues
   - Check ignored files in jest.config.js
   - Verify test paths
   - Check for untested code paths

## Future Improvements

1. Test Automation
   - Add visual regression testing
   - Implement API contract testing
   - Add load testing scenarios

2. Coverage
   - Increase test coverage targets
   - Add more edge cases
   - Improve mutation testing

3. Performance
   - Add more concurrent scenarios
   - Implement stress testing
   - Add memory leak detection

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow existing patterns
2. Add appropriate documentation
3. Update coverage targets if needed
4. Run all test suites before committing
5. Update this documentation if necessary
